        <p>Hello! My name is Duoduo Yao, a 21-year-old international student 
            originally from China. Currently, I'm pursuing my undergraduate 
            degree in Business Information Management at the University of 
            California, Irvine. My academic journey is fueled by a passion for 
            understanding the intricacies of business and technology, and how 
            they intertwine to shape our world.</p>
        <p>Outside the classroom, I have a diverse array of interests that 
            keep me engaged and constantly learning. I enjoy delving into the 
            world of books, where I explore various genres and themes, each 
            offering a new perspective or insight. Cooking is another passion 
            of mine; it's not just about the flavors for me, but also about 
            the creativity and love that goes into every dish. When it comes 
            to staying active, tennis is my go-to sport. It's not just a 
            physical activity for me, but also a way to challenge myself 
            and improve my focus and agility.</p>
        <p>Crafting is another arena where I express my creativity. Whether 
            it's creating something new or improvising on existing ideas, 
            crafting provides a therapeutic and rewarding experience. Socially, 
            I love spending time with my friends, exploring new places, 
            sharing experiences, and building memories. It's these moments 
            of laughter and shared stories that I cherish the most.</p>
        <p>My personality is a blend of introverted and extroverted traits, 
            making me an 'ambivert.' This unique combination allows me to adapt 
            to various social settings and enjoy both solitary and group 
            activities. Friends often describe me as resilient, a quality 
            that has helped me navigate the challenges of being an international 
            student and maintaining a positive outlook through it all.</p>
        <p>As I continue my journey at UCI, I look forward to further 
            developing these skills and qualities, preparing myself for 
            a fulfilling career and making meaningful contributions to 
            the community around me. Thank you for taking the time to get 
            to know a little about me!</p>
